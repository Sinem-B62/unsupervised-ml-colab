### unsupervised-ml-colab
Unsupervised learning project in Google Colab (K-Means)

The aim of this project is to investigate Prospect Auto's vehicle classification problem using an unsupervised learning method. To do this, the data complexity is first reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). The vehicles are then divided into groups using K-means clustering. Finally, an assessment is made as to whether this unsupervised approach represents a useful and efficient addition or alternative to a previously used supervised model.
